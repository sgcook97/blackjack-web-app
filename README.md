## Technical requirements
1. App runs on Flask server written in python
2. Postgres Database used to persist data
3. REST API integration: Deck of cards API
4. User Login

## Things we enjoyed / learned
1. We found it fun to work on implementing a working game of Black Jack 
2. We learned about using flask sessions so we could keep the same cards whenever a user uses the hit button

## Things we didn't enjoy / wanted to learn
1. We wanted to learn a more efficient way of working in the black jack logic
2. We wanted to learn more about making out web page look more like an actual black jack table
